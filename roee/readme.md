Create an interactive Bingo game themed around funny or relatable Passover Seder events, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should have two main screens:

Welcome Screen:

Visually festive, inspired by Passover themes.

Includes an input field to enter the player's name and a "Start" button.

Once the user enters their name and clicks "Start", transition to the Bingo game screen.

Bingo Game Screen:

Display a 5x5 Bingo board with humorous or relatable Seder moments (e.g., "Someone spills wine", "Child asks a random question", "Someone sings off-key", etc.).

The items should be randomly shuffled each time a new game is started.

Clicking a square marks it as selected (toggle on/off).

The player's board should be saved in localStorage, so if they refresh the page, their progress is retained.

(Optional: Add a "Bingo!" detection feature when a row, column, or diagonal is completed.)

Keep the code modular and clean. Bonus if you make it mobile-friendly and responsive.
use html, css and js only, no react or server side
